# Acumatica related problems

## 1. Scheduling of production orders

### Overview
- Process is where paperwork arrives at production schedulers in tray
- The production scheduler then needs to look at analysing the orders and then arranging them into batches to be done over the next weeks
- Enters the data into a spreadsheet
- The method is inconsistent and not driven by data 
- Difficult to have two people involved or measure performance of the process - largely manual
- Unable to easily identify constraints nor stock availability with orders in the future

### Solution
- Find some software that integrates into MYOB Acumatica that can optimise / automate the scheduling
- New project to support PAG, PSJ, ABRA, etc.


### Challenges
- Need accurate BOMs or Workcentres for this to work properly
- The More Manufacturing Opti-Planner is difficult to use and may not match our current process.

## 2. Late invoices - incurring manual processing fees from Bunnings
### Overview
- We are meant to send invoices to Bunnings on the day the item is received by the Bunnings Store
- There are a number of reasons why this does not happen and for each late invoice received, we are charged a $11 processing fee

### Solution
- 


### Challenges

## 3. Inaccurate invoices - 
### Overview
- Special Orders are required to be Ship Complete - all items on the order are to be sent in 1 shipment
- Special orders are not processed properly via TOE
- Workaround process has 3PL's sending through items shipped to Bunnings AND sending to accounts for the manual invoice creation
- Problem is that 3PL's don't always obey the ship complete rule and then we send an invoice for the TOTAL and not for the actual item, resulting in the potential for a FINE
