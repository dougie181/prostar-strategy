- **Operational Excellence:** Streamlining manufacturing processes for both standard products and custom orders

### Specific Business Objectives IT Must Support

- **Supply Chain Visibility:** Complete tracking from China-sourced products through 3PL delivery to final Bunnings stores
- **Manufacturing Optimisation:** Better visibility and control of manufacturing performance metrics and processes
- **Custom Order Management:** Seamless handling of bespoke items (raked aluminium panels, sliding doors, glass panels)
- **Inventory Intelligence:** Effective management of Ready-to-Assemble parent/child relationships for accurate picking and delivery
- **Purchasing Efficiency:** Streamlined purchasing processes eliminating manual workarounds across multiple systems
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Real-time dashboards and trend analysis for operational and tactical management

### Operational Changes Expected

- Continued growth in Bunnings business requiring scalable systems
- Increasing complexity in custom manufacturing requirements
- Need for more automated and integrated business processes
- Enhanced reporting and analytics capabilities for performance management
