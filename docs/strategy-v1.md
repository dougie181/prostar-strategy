### Experimental/R&D Initiatives

**These initiatives are being developed to prove value before full investment approval.**

#### 1. Data Warehouse MVP (Experimental)

**Business Problem:** Limited data visibility and reporting capabilities. Need to prove value of data warehouse approach before full investment.

**Business Value:** (To be proven)
- Enable data-driven decision making
- Prevent stockouts and identify logistical issues
- Identify operational trends and optimisation opportunities

**Status:** Experimental/R&D - Being built in spare time
**Investment:** Minimal (Mac Studio + development time)
**Timeline:** MVP target completion: End of February 2025

**Current Approach:**
- Building data collector that can grab data and store in SQL database on Mac Studio
- Iterative approach to demonstrate value over time
- Starting with Sales & Marketing data, then Manufacturing

**Success Criteria:**
- Feedback from senior management team/executive on usefulness
- Evidence of improved decision-making
- Demonstrates value sufficient for full implementation business case

**Failure Scenario:** If MVP doesn't demonstrate clear value, may be used for internal IT purposes only, or discontinued.

**Next Steps:**
- Complete MVP development (target: End of February 2025)
- Demonstrate to Sales & Marketing team
- Gather feedback and iterate
- If successful, demonstrate to Manufacturing team
- If executive team sees value, develop business case for full implementation
- If not successful, use for internal IT or discontinue

**Note:** If successful and wins executive support, may acquire dedicated resource to maintain and enhance over time.

### Aspirational Initiatives

**These are long-term vision items for future consideration. Business cases would be required if pursued.**

#### 1. Internal Software Development Capability

**Business Problem:** All development currently outsourced. Higher costs, slower speed, dependency on external partners.

**Potential Business Value:**
- Speed and flexibility in development
- Knowledge retention within organisation
- Ability to work on internal optimisation projects with lower ROI thresholds
- Ideation and custom solution development

**Status:** Aspirational - Unlikely to be approved in near-term, but included as strategic option
**Investment:** ~$140,000/year salary + benefits + tools + training
**ROI Analysis Required:**
- Cost comparison: Internal vs external development
- Break-even analysis (project volume required)
- Value of speed, flexibility, knowledge retention
- Long-term strategic value

**Potential Scope:**
- Internal business optimisation tools (manufacturing, operations)
- Acumatica customisations
- Custom integrations
- Web applications and planners (partial support)
- Maintenance and support of custom solutions

**Approach:** 
- Would require comprehensive business case
- Cost alone difficult to justify - need to demonstrate strategic value
- Long-term goal rather than immediate priority

**Note:** Current development is outsourced to partners (~$20-30k per planner). Internal capability could reduce project costs by ~1/3 + provide maintenance in-house, but break-even analysis needed.

#### 2. Comprehensive Best-Practice Frameworks

**Business Problem:** No formal frameworks for vendor management, disaster recovery, data governance, change management, etc.

**Potential Business Value:** Ensure we "keep the lights on," manage business interruptions/disasters, manage IT risk well.

**Status:** Aspirational - Framework to be established, but comprehensive implementation may be aspirational

**Frameworks to Consider:**
- Vendor & Partner Management Strategy
- Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity (minimum viable approach may be sufficient)
- Data Governance & Privacy (minimum viable approach may be sufficient)
- Change Management & User Adoption
- Technology Lifecycle & Refresh Strategy
- IT Service Management (ITSM) standards

**Approach:**
- Phase 0 assessment work will identify gaps
- Prioritise based on risk and business impact
- Implement minimum viable frameworks first
- Build incrementally based on need
- Avoid over-engineering upfront

**Note:** COBIT gap analysis will help identify which frameworks are essential vs. nice-to-have. Start with highest-risk areas, build incrementally.
